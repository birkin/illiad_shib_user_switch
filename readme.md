- experimentation tunneling through shib.

- goal: to see if i can tunnel through shib with a test user-account, then switch the illiad user to a legit-user account.

    - This would allow us to shibbify the main illiad login for users (in front of illiad's remote-auth backend),

    - and allow non-shib users to use a separte illiad-db-authNZ url,

    - and maintain the existing easyAccess programmatic login on behalf of users (using illiad's remote-auth backend)
